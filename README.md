# web-site-traffic
The application is intended to allow a user to be able to know the number of visitors to a provided web site.

## Thinking process
1. The user should be able to paste a link on the page.
2. The user should be able to request for the results of the number of visitors to the provided sites.
3. On request for results the applicatiion should be able to fetch results from an api.
4. after successful response from api, the results should be proccessed and displayed to the user.

## Opinion
The task was an interesting one and very educative and hope is not complex than it sounds. It would have been easier if an api was provided for the task.

## Challenges
-- challenges include:
- The getting an api for the analyzing a given website.
- choosing what to display from the api and how to present it to the user.

## Standards followed
Clean code standards were followed but there be unused modules and packages which are intended for future work.
